# RougeKingdom
Started work on this game around June 2020  

The idea is Diablo 3 X Factorio.

You make the magic items in the world



#Current goals
  * inventory system (75% done?)
  * NPC's Entities
    * Peasant
    * Goblin
  * Pathfinding
  * World resource generator




#ideas I want to add
NPC's with a "want's" system.
  IE:
    peasant 1, Wants axe
      to craft axe needs 2 rocks and a log
        does peasant need this? No then craft the axe
          if the peasant needs the ingredients
            add wants for log & rock
            look around in the world for something that
            can provide the log & rocks


  Some kind of faction system
    this way I can start working on towns/village system
    that can fight each other.

    A area would have to be tagged owned by X faction
    Who runs the faction? How does a faction get created?
    Do faction's have wants?
    There is a lot to answer here and a lot to think about.
